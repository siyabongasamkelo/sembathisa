# Sembathisa Ubukhosi Foundation 🌍

A responsive, modern website built for the **Sembathisa Ubukhosi Foundation**, focused on presenting the foundation’s mission, values, and community impact in a clear and accessible way.

This project is part of my portfolio and represents my growth in translating **Figma designs into real, responsive browser layouts** while following **systematic design and front‑end best practices**.

---

## ✨ Project Goals

* Communicate the foundation’s mission clearly
* Build a clean, accessible, and responsive UI
* Translate design intent (not just pixels) from Figma to the browser
* Apply consistent spacing, typography, and layout systems
* Practice real‑world front‑end workflows

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **React**
* **Styled Components** (component‑based styling)
* **HTML5**
* **CSS3**
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**
* **Git & GitHub** for version control

---

## 🎨 Design Approach

* Mobile‑first responsive design
* Systematic spacing and typography (design‑system thinking)
* Flexible layouts that scroll naturally instead of forcing content into fixed heights
* Focus on layout behavior across screen sizes rather than pixel‑perfect matching

---

## 📱 Responsiveness

The website is tested across multiple viewport ranges:

* Mobile (360px – 414px)
* Tablet (768px)
* Desktop (900px – 1440px+)

Layouts adapt fluidly, ensuring readability and usability on different devices.
